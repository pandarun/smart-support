# Specification Quality Checklist: Persistent Embedding Storage

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… Ready for planning

The specification is complete and all strategic decisions have been resolved:
- **Q1**: Both SQLite and PostgreSQL with abstraction layer
- **Q2**: Explicit migration command
- **Q3**: Content hash comparison

All requirements are testable, success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic, and user scenarios are clearly defined with priorities.

## Design Decisions Summary

1. **Storage Technology**: Abstraction layer supporting both SQLite (default) and PostgreSQL (optional)
2. **Migration Strategy**: Explicit CLI command for one-time migration
3. **Change Detection**: SHA256 content hashing for incremental updates

## Notes

The specification follows the template correctly and provides comprehensive coverage of the persistent embedding storage feature with all strategic decisions documented.

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1: Fast startup is MVP)
- Measurable success criteria (startup time < 2s, zero data loss)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Well-defined scope boundaries
- Realistic assumptions documented
- All design decisions resolved with clear rationale
