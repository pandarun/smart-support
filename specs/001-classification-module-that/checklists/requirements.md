# Specification Quality Checklist: Classification Module

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Spec describes WHAT (classification of inquiries) and WHY (operator efficiency, hackathon scoring) without HOW
- ✅ User stories focus on operator workflows and business value (accuracy, speed, evaluation points)
- ✅ Language is accessible - no code, no technical architecture
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete
- ✅ All FRs are testable: input validation (FR-009), accuracy threshold (FR-004), response time (FR-003), etc.
- ✅ Success criteria use measurable metrics: "70% accuracy", "2 seconds", "100% completion rate"
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation: "operators identify topics instantly" not "API responds in 200ms"
- ✅ Each user story has 3 acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- ✅ 6 edge cases identified covering empty input, API failures, concurrent requests, etc.
- ✅ Scope bounded by Assumptions section: validation dataset provided, FAQ structure stable, etc.
- ✅ 7 assumptions documented covering data sources, API limits, and usage patterns

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ 12 Functional Requirements with specific behaviors defined (e.g., FR-001: 5-5000 char input)
- ✅ 3 user stories prioritized P1-P3 covering single, validation, and batch classification
- ✅ 6 Success Criteria directly measurable: accuracy %, response time, completion rate
- ✅ No mention of Python, FastAPI, database schemas, or code structure anywhere in spec

## Validation Result

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All checklist items validated successfully

**Summary**:
- Total items: 16
- Passed: 16
- Failed: 0

**Readiness**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase

## Notes

The specification successfully captures business requirements without implementation details. All requirements are testable and measurable. No clarifications needed - reasonable defaults applied for validation dataset format and FAQ structure based on hackathon context and constitution principles.

Key strengths:
- User stories directly map to hackathon evaluation criteria (30 points for classification accuracy)
- Performance and quality requirements align with constitution targets (70% accuracy, <2s response time)
- Independent testability achieved (Principle I: Modular Architecture)
- Clear success criteria enable validation against provided dataset (Principle III: Data-Driven Validation)
