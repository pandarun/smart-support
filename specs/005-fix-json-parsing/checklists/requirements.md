# Specification Quality Checklist: JSON Parsing with Markdown Code Block Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**Date**: 2025-10-16

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: The spec focuses on WHAT needs to happen (stripping markdown, parsing JSON) without specifying HOW (no mention of specific functions, regex patterns, or code structure).

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories describe observable outcomes (successful parsing, error handling) that directly benefit users and operations.

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written in business terms (reliability, robustness, error handling) that non-developers can understand.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully filled out.

### Requirement Review

✅ **No clarification markers**: All requirements are concrete and specific.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified through testing (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by providing markdown-wrapped JSON and verifying it's stripped).

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items include quantifiable metrics (100%, zero errors, <1ms, etc.).

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on outcomes (parsing success, error rates, performance) without mentioning specific technologies.

✅ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each user story includes given-when-then scenarios covering the key flows.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: The spec explicitly lists 5 edge cases with expected behaviors.

✅ **Clear scope**: The scope is bounded to JSON parsing with markdown handling, doesn't expand into other areas.

✅ **Dependencies/assumptions**: The spec implicitly assumes the existing classification system structure (mentions maintaining existing error handling).

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each FR implies clear pass/fail conditions through the user stories.

✅ **Primary flows covered**: Three prioritized user stories cover the essential flows (basic parsing, format variations, error handling).

✅ **Measurable outcomes**: Six specific success criteria provide clear targets for feature completion.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: The spec successfully avoids implementation details throughout.

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- No updates needed before proceeding to `/speckit.plan`
- All quality criteria met on first validation
