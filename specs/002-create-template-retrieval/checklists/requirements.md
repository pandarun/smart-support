# Specification Quality Checklist: Template Retrieval Module

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - **PASS**: Spec focuses on user needs and outcomes; Scibox API is mentioned only where mandated by hackathon requirements
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - **PASS**: All user stories clearly articulate operator/administrator value and hackathon scoring impact
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - **PASS**: Language is clear and accessible; technical concepts (embeddings, cosine similarity) are explained in context
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - **PASS**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria all present and comprehensive

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - **PASS**: All aspects are clearly specified with informed defaults
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - **PASS**: All 18 functional requirements have specific, measurable criteria (e.g., "within 1 second", "top-K templates", "≥80% accuracy")
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - **PASS**: All success criteria include quantitative metrics (percentages, time limits, counts)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - **PASS**: Focused on user-visible outcomes (response time, accuracy, concurrent handling) without implementation details
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - **PASS**: Each of 3 user stories has 3 detailed Given-When-Then scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified - **PASS**: 7 edge cases documented covering API failures, empty categories, low similarity scores, concurrent requests, and knowledge base updates
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - **PASS**: 3 prioritized user stories (P1: Retrieval, P2: Precomputation, P3: Validation) with independent testing criteria
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - **PASS**: Comprehensive Assumptions section covers validation datasets, API quotas, embedding validity, classification integration, and memory constraints

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - **PASS**: Each requirement is specific and measurable (e.g., FR-008 "within 1 second (95th percentile)", FR-013 "generates an accuracy report")
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - **PASS**: P1 covers core operator workflow, P2 covers system initialization, P3 covers quality validation
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - **PASS**: All success criteria (SC-001 through SC-006) are directly testable and aligned with requirements
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - **PASS**: Spec describes what the system does from user perspective; Scibox API mentioned only where mandated by hackathon constraints

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

**Readiness**: Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`

**Notes**:
- Scibox bge-m3 embeddings API is mentioned explicitly because it's mandated by the hackathon technical constraints (similar to Classification Module's use of Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-AWQ)
- Historical success rate weighting (FR-018) is marked as "SHOULD" (optional) to keep MVP scope focused on core semantic similarity ranking
- Assumptions section appropriately documents defaults (e.g., in-memory storage acceptable for ~100-200 templates, cosine similarity appropriate for Russian language domain)
- Edge cases comprehensively cover API failures, empty result sets, concurrent access, and knowledge base updates

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan and design artifacts
