# Feature Specification: Operator Web Interface

**Feature Branch**: `004-smart-support-operator`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Smart Support Operator Web Interface - A professional web application that provides support operators with an intuitive interface to classify customer inquiries and retrieve relevant template responses."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Inquiry Analysis and Template Retrieval (Priority: P1)

As a support operator, I need to quickly analyze customer inquiries and retrieve relevant template responses so that I can respond to customers accurately and efficiently.

**Why this priority**: This is the core workflow that delivers the primary business value - enabling operators to handle customer inquiries faster with higher accuracy. Without this, the system provides no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a customer inquiry, receiving classification results, viewing ranked template responses, and successfully copying a response. Delivers immediate value by reducing response time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an operator has received a customer inquiry, **When** they enter the inquiry text into the interface, **Then** the system displays the classification (category and subcategory) within 2 seconds
2. **Given** an inquiry has been classified, **When** the classification completes, **Then** the system automatically displays top 5 ranked template responses within 1 second
3. **Given** template responses are displayed, **When** the operator reviews the results, **Then** each template shows the question, answer, and similarity score with visual confidence indicators (high/medium/low)
4. **Given** the operator has found a suitable template, **When** they click to copy the response, **Then** the answer text is copied to their clipboard for use in their communication tool

### User Story 2 - Response Customization (Priority: P2)

As a support operator, I need to edit template responses before sending them so that I can personalize answers and adapt them to specific customer situations.

**Why this priority**: While template responses provide good starting points, operators often need to customize them. This enhances response quality but isn't strictly required for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting a template response, editing the text, and verifying the edited version can be copied. Delivers value by allowing response personalization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a template response is displayed, **When** the operator selects it for editing, **Then** the answer text becomes editable in a text editor
2. **Given** the operator has edited a response, **When** they save or copy it, **Then** the edited version is available for copying
3. **Given** the operator is editing a response, **When** they want to revert changes, **Then** they can restore the original template text

---

### User Story 3 - Classification Confidence Assessment (Priority: P2)

As a support operator, I need to see confidence scores for classifications and template matches so that I can make informed decisions about which responses to use.

**Why this priority**: Helps operators understand system confidence and make better judgments, but the system can function without it. Improves decision quality rather than enabling core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by analyzing various inquiries and verifying confidence scores are displayed with appropriate visual indicators. Delivers value by improving operator decision-making.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an inquiry has been classified, **When** results are displayed, **Then** the classification confidence score is shown as a percentage with a visual indicator (green >80%, yellow 60-80%, red <60%)
2. **Given** template responses are ranked, **When** results are displayed, **Then** each template shows its similarity score with corresponding visual indicators
3. **Given** confidence is low (<60%), **When** results are displayed, **Then** the operator sees a visual warning suggesting manual review

---

### User Story 4 - Error Recovery and System Feedback (Priority: P3)

As a support operator, I need clear feedback when the system encounters errors so that I can take appropriate action and continue working.

**Why this priority**: Error handling is important for production use but not critical for demonstrating core functionality. Can be basic for MVP and enhanced later.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating various error conditions and verifying operators receive clear, actionable feedback. Delivers value by preventing operator confusion during issues.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the system cannot connect to classification service, **When** an error occurs, **Then** the operator sees a user-friendly message explaining the issue and suggested next steps
2. **Given** an inquiry is being processed, **When** the classification takes longer than expected, **Then** the operator sees a loading indicator showing work in progress
3. **Given** the system receives an invalid inquiry (e.g., non-Russian text), **When** validation fails, **Then** the operator sees a clear explanation of what needs to be corrected

---

### User Story 5 - Performance Monitoring (Priority: P3)

As a support operator, I want to see processing times for classification and retrieval so that I can understand system performance and manage customer expectations.

**Why this priority**: Provides transparency but isn't essential for core functionality. Helps with performance awareness but doesn't block primary workflow.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by processing inquiries and verifying processing time metrics are displayed accurately. Delivers value by setting appropriate operator expectations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an inquiry has been processed, **When** results are displayed, **Then** the classification processing time is shown (e.g., "Classified in 1.2s")
2. **Given** templates have been retrieved, **When** results are displayed, **Then** the retrieval processing time is shown (e.g., "Retrieved in 0.5s")
3. **Given** processing times exceed thresholds (>2s classification or >1s retrieval), **When** results are displayed, **Then** the time is highlighted as slow

### Edge Cases

- **Empty inquiry**: What happens when operator submits empty text or very short inquiry (<5 words)?
- **Non-Russian text**: How does system handle inquiries in languages other than Russian?
- **Ambiguous classification**: What happens when confidence is very low (<40%) across all categories?
- **No template matches**: How does system respond when no relevant templates are found for a category?
- **Concurrent operations**: What happens if operator submits a new inquiry while previous one is still processing?
- **Network timeout**: How does system handle slow or failed API responses?
- **Very long inquiries**: How does system handle customer complaints or inquiries exceeding 1000 words?
- **Special characters**: How are inquiries with formatting, emojis, or code snippets handled?

## Assumptions *(optional)*

### Workflow Assumptions
- **A-001**: Operators use the interface as a tool to prepare responses, not as a complete customer communication system
- **A-002**: Operators will copy responses to external communication tools (email, chat, ticketing system) rather than sending directly
- **A-003**: One inquiry is processed at a time; operators complete one inquiry before starting another
- **A-004**: Operators work at desktop computers with standard screen sizes (1920x1080 or larger)

### Integration Assumptions

### User Assumptions
- **A-009**: Operators understand Russian language and can evaluate template quality
- **A-010**: Operators have basic computer literacy (typing, copy/paste, basic editing)
- **A-011**: Operators can make judgment calls about which template best fits the customer inquiry

### Scope Assumptions
