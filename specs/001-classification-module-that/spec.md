# Feature Specification: Classification Module

**Feature Branch**: `001-classification-module-that`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Classification module that analyzes Russian customer banking inquiries and determines product category and subcategory using Scibox Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-AWQ model. Must achieve ≥70% accuracy on validation dataset and respond in <2 seconds."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Single Inquiry Classification (Priority: P1)

A support operator receives a customer inquiry in Russian and needs to quickly determine which product category and subcategory it relates to so they can route it correctly or find relevant template responses.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality worth 30 points in hackathon evaluation. Without accurate classification, the entire Smart Support system cannot function. This is the foundation for the ranking module and operator interface.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a single inquiry text (e.g., "Как открыть счет?") and verifying that the system returns a category (e.g., "Счета и вклады") and subcategory (e.g., "Открытие счета") within 2 seconds with accuracy validated against known test cases.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a clear customer inquiry about account opening, **When** the operator submits the text for classification, **Then** the system returns the correct category and subcategory within 2 seconds
2. **Given** a customer inquiry with multiple topics, **When** the operator submits the text, **Then** the system returns the primary (most relevant) category and subcategory
3. **Given** an ambiguous inquiry, **When** the operator submits the text, **Then** the system returns the best-match category/subcategory with a confidence score

### User Story 2 - Validation Dataset Testing (Priority: P2)

The system must be validated against a provided dataset of inquiries with known correct classifications to ensure it meets the 70% accuracy requirement before being deployed for operator use.

**Why this priority**: Hackathon scoring awards 10 points per correct classification on validation dataset (3 inquiries = 30 points). This validates the classification quality before operators depend on it.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the classification module against all inquiries in the validation dataset, comparing predicted categories/subcategories to ground truth, and calculating accuracy percentage. Delivers measurable quality metric for hackathon evaluation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the validation dataset with 3+ inquiries, **When** each inquiry is classified, **Then** at least 70% (minimum 2 of 3) are correctly classified for both category and subcategory
2. **Given** a validation inquiry with ground truth labels, **When** classified by the module, **Then** the predicted category and subcategory match the ground truth labels
3. **Given** all validation results, **When** accuracy is calculated, **Then** the system reports overall accuracy, per-category accuracy, and identifies misclassification patterns

### User Story 3 - Batch Classification Processing (Priority: P3)

For quality assurance or analytics purposes, the system can process multiple inquiries in batch mode, classifying them efficiently without requiring individual operator submissions.

**Why this priority**: Enables bulk validation testing, performance benchmarking, and quality monitoring. Not critical for MVP operator workflow but valuable for system evaluation and continuous improvement.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting an array of 10+ inquiries and verifying all are classified correctly with total processing time under 20 seconds (2s per inquiry limit maintained), returning results in the same order as input.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a batch of 10 inquiries, **When** submitted for classification, **Then** all inquiries are classified and results returned within 20 seconds total
2. **Given** a batch with mixed valid and invalid inquiries, **When** processed, **Then** valid inquiries are classified successfully and invalid ones return appropriate error messages without stopping the batch
3. **Given** batch processing results, **When** returned to the operator, **Then** each result includes the original inquiry text, predicted category, predicted subcategory, and processing timestamp

### Edge Cases

- What happens when inquiry text is empty or only whitespace? System should return error message indicating insufficient input for classification
- What happens when inquiry is in a language other than Russian? System should attempt classification but may have lower confidence; operator should be notified
- What happens when inquiry doesn't match any known category? System should return the closest match with a low confidence score and suggest manual review
- What happens when the LLM API is unavailable or times out? System should return error message with retry suggestion and log the failure for monitoring
- What happens when inquiry is extremely long (>1000 words)? System should process the first relevant portion or summarize before classification to stay within response time limits
- What happens when multiple operators submit inquiries simultaneously? System should handle concurrent requests without accuracy or performance degradation

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept Russian-language customer inquiry text as input (minimum 5 characters, maximum 5000 characters)
- **FR-002**: System MUST return exactly one product category and one subcategory for each inquiry
- **FR-003**: System MUST return classification results within 2 seconds for single inquiries (95th percentile)
- **FR-004**: System MUST achieve minimum 70% accuracy on validation dataset inquiries when comparing both category and subcategory predictions to ground truth
- **FR-005**: System MUST use Scibox Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-AWQ model for classification analysis
- **FR-006**: System MUST include confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0) for each classification result
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle API authentication using SCIBOX_API_KEY environment variable
- **FR-008**: System MUST log each classification request with timestamp, inquiry text (truncated if necessary), predicted category/subcategory, confidence score, and processing time
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate input text is non-empty and contains at least one Cyrillic character
- **FR-010**: System MUST return meaningful error messages for invalid inputs, API failures, or timeout scenarios
- **FR-011**: System MUST match categories and subcategories from the VTB Belarus FAQ database structure
- **FR-012**: System MUST support batch processing of multiple inquiries with results returned in the same order as inputs

### Performance Requirements

- **PR-001**: Single inquiry classification MUST complete within 2 seconds (target: 1.5 seconds average)
- **PR-002**: Batch processing MUST maintain <2 second per-inquiry average processing time
- **PR-003**: System MUST handle at least 10 concurrent classification requests without degradation

### Quality Requirements

- **QR-001**: Overall classification accuracy MUST be ≥70% on validation dataset
- **QR-002**: Classification results MUST be deterministic (same inquiry produces same result with same model state)
- **QR-003**: Confidence scores MUST correlate with accuracy (higher confidence should indicate higher likelihood of correct classification)

### Key Entities

- **Inquiry**: Customer question or request text in Russian, the primary input to the classification system
- **Category**: Top-level product classification (e.g., "Счета и вклады", "Кредиты", "Карты") from VTB Belarus FAQ structure
- **Subcategory**: Second-level classification under a category (e.g., "Открытие счета", "Закрытие счета") from VTB Belarus FAQ structure
- **Classification Result**: Output containing predicted category, predicted subcategory, confidence score, and processing metadata
- **Validation Record**: Ground truth pairing of inquiry text with correct category and subcategory for accuracy testing

## Assumptions

- Validation dataset will be provided by hackathon organizers with ground truth category/subcategory labels
- VTB Belarus FAQ database contains the complete list of valid categories and subcategories
- Scibox API has sufficient quota/rate limits to support validation testing and demo usage
- Russian language inquiries use standard modern Russian (not heavily dialectical or archaic)
- Inquiry text has already been extracted from customer communication channels (no need to handle email parsing, chat formatting, etc.)
- Categories and subcategories in FAQ database are stable and won't change during hackathon period
- Single operator usage pattern for MVP (concurrent load testing is for robustness, not primary use case)
