# Specification Quality Checklist: Operator Web Interface

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses entirely on user needs, operator workflows, and business value. No mention of React, FastAPI, or other implementation technologies. Written in plain language suitable for business stakeholders.

### Requirement Completeness
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are testable (e.g., "System MUST complete inquiry classification within 2 seconds"). No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all potential ambiguities resolved with documented assumptions. Edge cases comprehensively identified.

### Success Criteria Quality
✅ **PASS** - All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-001: "Operators can process a customer inquiry from input to copied response in under 10 seconds" (user-focused, measurable)
- SC-002: "Classification results are displayed within 2 seconds of inquiry submission for 95% of requests" (measurable performance)
- SC-010: "Interface scores at least 16/20 points on hackathon UI/UX evaluation criteria" (business metric)
- No implementation details (no mention of APIs, frameworks, databases)

### User Scenarios
✅ **PASS** - Five user stories prioritized by business value (P1-P3). Each story is independently testable with clear acceptance scenarios using Given/When/Then format. Covers core workflow (P1), enhancements (P2), and nice-to-haves (P3).

### Scope Management
✅ **PASS** - Clear boundaries established:
- 15 assumptions documented (workflow, integration, user, scope)
- 7 dependencies identified (internal and external)
- 10 explicitly excluded features in "Out of Scope" section
- Future enhancements listed separately

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification is complete, high-quality, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`. All checklist items pass validation. The spec successfully:

1. Defines clear user value and business outcomes
2. Avoids all implementation details
3. Provides testable, unambiguous requirements
4. Establishes measurable success criteria
5. Documents assumptions and dependencies
6. Clearly defines scope boundaries

No revisions needed. Proceed to implementation planning phase.
